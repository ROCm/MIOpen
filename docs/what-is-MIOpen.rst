What is MIOpen?
----------------------

MIOpen, AMD's open-source deep learning primitives library for GPUs, provides highly optimized implementations of such operators, shielding researchers from internal implementation details and hence, accelerating the time to discovery.

MIOpen innovates on several fronts, such as implementing fusion to optimize for memory bandwidth and GPU launch overheads, providing an auto-tuning infrastructure to overcome the large design space of problem configurations, and implementing different algorithms to optimize convolutions for different filter and input sizes. MIOpen is one of the first libraries to publicly support the bfloat16 data-type for convolutions, allowing efficient training at lower precision without the loss of accuracy.
