Fusion API overview
--------------------

Increasing depth of deep learning networks necessitate the need for novel mechanisms to improve performance on GPUs. One mechanism to achieve higher efficiency is to _fuse_ separate kernels into a single kernel to reduce off-chip memory access and avoid kernel launch overhead. This document outlines the addition of a Fusion API to the MIOpen library. The fusion API would allow users to specify operators that they wants to fuse in a single kernel, compile it and then launch the kernel. While not all combinations might be supported by the library, the API is flexible enough to allow the specification of many operations in any order from a finite set of supported operations. The API provides a mechanism to report unsupported combinations.

A complete example of the Fusion API in the context of MIOpen is given `here <https://github.com/ROCm/MIOpenExamples/tree/master/fusion>`_. We will use code from the example project as we go along. The example project creates a fusion plan to merge the convolution, bias and activation operations. For a list of supported fusion operations and associated constraints please refer to the [Supported Fusions](#supported-fusions) section. The example depicts bare-bones code without any error checking or even populating the tensors with meaningful data in the interest of simplicity.

The following list outlines the steps required:

- Create a fusion plan
- Create and add the convolution, bias and activation operators
- Compile the Fusion Plan 
- Set the runtime arguments for each operator
- Execute the fusion plan
- Cleanup

The above steps assume that an MIOpen handle object has already been initialized. Moreover, the order in which operators are created is important, since it represents the order of operations on the data itself. Therefore a fusion plan with convolution created before activation is a different fusion plan as opposed to if activation was added before convolution. 

The following sections further elaborate the above steps as well as give code examples to make these ideas concrete.

Intended Audience
==================
The primary consumers of the fusion API are high level frameworks such as TensorFlow/XLA or PyTorch etc.
